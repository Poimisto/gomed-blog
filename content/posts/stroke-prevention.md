Stroke is one of those health challenges that creep up on you without warning. It doesn't matter where you are or what you're doing. You could be talking, driving, eating, or having a good time with your friends, then suddenly, one side of your body becomes numb. 

Some people call it a brain attack because it impedes the normal functioning of your brain. In case you don't know, your brain is your body's powerhouse. If your brain is compromised, then your whole body is in danger.

## How Does Stroke Occur? 

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to a part of your brain is blocked or a blood vessel in the brain bursts. They are called ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, respectively. Sometimes, it starts with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It is a mini-stroke that happens temporarily. 

When a stroke occurs, it weakens your muscles and paralyses one side of your body. You may feel a numbness in your face and have difficulty speaking. In extreme cases, a stroke can even lead to death.

That is why you must be wary of anything that makes you susceptible to stroke. We agreed stroke could be linked to your genes and age. However, most times, stroke can be triggered by poor lifestyle choices. This article will address some of these lifestyle choices and show you what you can do to prevent stroke.

## How to Prevent Stroke

You can prevent stroke by making healthy choices and controlling any risk factors that make you susceptible to stroke. Those healthy choices include: 

**1. Eat Healthy Meals**

The first step in preventing stroke is watching what goes into your mouth. Eating fast food and snacks high in saturated or trans fat can increase your cholesterol levels. This cholesterol can clog your arteries, making it difficult for blood to flow freely. In the long run, this could lead to ischemic stroke.

If you don’t want to go through all that trouble, choose healthy food and drink options today. Eat more fibre, whole grains, low-fat dairy, fish, fresh fruits, and veggies. Stay away from red meat, refined grains, and sugary drinks. Don't forget to drink lots of water to stay hydrated. 

**2. Maintain a Healthy Weight**

Do you know that being overweight increases your risk of stroke? Putting on that extra weight may make you look bold and curvy. It may make your clothes fit better and boost your self-esteem, but it also exposes you to other complications that can jeopardise your health. For one, it can increase your cholesterol levels and blood pressure, which puts you at risk of diabetes and stroke.

Do you know how much you weigh? Go to the nearest clinic to check your body mass index (BMI) and confirm. If you are overweight, losing as little as 10 pounds can put you out of the stroke danger zone. You can start a weightless journey by reducing your daily calorie intake and engaging in simple physical activity like walking and jogging. You can also join a fitness club or register in a gym. 

Exercising isn't just good for your heart. It also keeps you fit. Don't you want to have that six-pack and banging body you've always dreamed of? We bet you do! All you need is as little as 15 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise daily.

**3. Say "No" to Drinking and Smoking**

Why are you running? The truth is bitter, but we must say it. Drinking alcohol and smoking may be fun for you, but it is bad for your health. Reduce your alcohol intake and quit smoking today. 

Smoking increases clot formation and reduces the oxygen in your blood, which gives room for stroke. Same with alcohol. You may say it's just one bottle or one stick of cigarette. But as the saying goes, little drops of water make a big ocean. The effect of those little daily or weekly doses builds up over time and escalates into more damaging complications.

If you stay around people who smoke, you're no better. When you breathe in smoke exhaled by smokers, you are just as liable as they are. Studies show that secondhand smoke increases your risk of stroke by 20-30%. The more you stay away from smoking areas, the better for you.

**4. Manage Your Blood Pressure**

The scary thing about high blood pressure is that it usually has no symptoms. It creeps up on you when you least expect without warning and can cause lasting damage. It is the most common cause of stroke in both men and women. That is why you must check your blood pressure regularly. 

With our trusted care kit, you can check your blood pressure in the comfort of your home. If your blood pressure is high, take your meds and follow your doctor’s recommended food and lifestyle changes judiciously. Reduce your salt intake, avoid high-cholesterol foods, and exercise regularly.

**5. Identify and Manage Your Risk Factors**

Some disease conditions make you easily susceptible to stroke. These diseases include; diabetes, atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), carotid artery disease, atherosclerosis, and other heart diseases. These health conditions can increase clot formation and damage your blood vessels. You may wonder why the heart is in the centre of the picture. That's because stroke affects blood circulation, and your heart is the chief circulation officer. 

Whatever your health challenges may be, make sure you adhere strictly to your treatment plan. Eat a healthy diet and exercise daily. Check your blood sugar regularly and keep it in control. Take your medications and follow your doctor’s instructions judiciously. Remember, we do not support self-medication and drug misuse. If you don't understand anything, ask questions.

### Conclusion

Now you know what you can do to prevent stroke, start reining your risks today. If you know any habit or choices that could sabotage your health and predispose you to stroke, pause and retrace your steps. Maintain a healthy lifestyle and listen to your body. Don't ignore the signs or give it a chance to strike. If something is off, get help from a medical professional immediately.

If you’ve already had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), you can still prevent further occurrences with the help of a competent healthcare team. You can reduce the risk of another stroke by adhering to your treatment plan and speaking to a doctor about your symptoms. You don’t need to book an appointment or wait long hours in the clinic.
