Do you have trouble sleeping at night?

After a long day busting your ass at work, you crawl into bed, ready to get that much-needed rest. But all you can do is stare at the ceiling with your eyes wide open, unable to sleep. Even when you do, you restlessly wake up at intervals.

You probably have insomnia. That's why you can't sleep. Insomnia is a sleep disorder that makes it hard to sleep or stay asleep through the night. It makes you sleep a lot less than you really want to. That's why you feel tired, moody, and anxious during the day. But not to worry, we are here to help you fix your insomnia permanently.

Hold on! We know what you're thinking. No, we are not here to tell you a bunch of drugs to take. Although that could help, in this article, our focus is to show you natural and effective ways to fix your insomnia permanently without drowning in medications. 
Are you ready for it?

Okay, let's dive in!

Effective Ways to Fix Your Insomnia Permanently 

If you want to get your sleep back on track, here are some effective ways you can fix your insomnia permanently.

## 1. Stick to a Consistent Bedtime

The first step is to have a consistent bedtime. You may not like the idea of being locked into such a routine as it reminds you of lights out in boarding school. Now, you're an adult and need all the freedom you can get. 

However, our brains are programmed to follow patterns. So, by going to bed at the same time every day, you're gradually telling your mind what it ought to do. Your body becomes accustomed to it. In the long run, you'll notice that you tend to feel sleepy or involuntarily fall asleep at that time. You could be watching a movie or chatting with a friend; the next minute, you're fast asleep on the couch. 

## 2. Create a Calm Bedtime Routine

Children have bedtime routines like listening to lullabies and bedtime stories. These routines help them wind down and gradually fall asleep. Who says you can't do the same as an adult? If you want to fix your insomnia permanently, create a bedtime routine and ambience that helps calm your body and mind, preparing you for sleep. 

For some people, taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to solemn music helps them fall asleep faster. For others, decorating their bedroom with cool, dark colours and dim bulb lights, wearing an eye mask, or using soft pillows do the magic. Find out what works for you and stick to it. You'd be surprised at how it would fix your insomnia permanently.

## 3. Set Work Boundaries in Your Bedroom 

We know it's the era of remote work, and you probably work from home, but please reserve your bed solely for sleep. Don't use it as a substitute workstation, especially at night. Leave your electronic devices, including your cell phone, outside the bedroom. You can keep them in your home office or living room. If you must bring your devices into the bedroom, turn them off at least 30 minutes to one hour before bedtime. These little steps will go a long way to fix your insomnia permanently.

In case you're wondering why you have to follow all these rules, let's give you a little science lecture. The blue rays from the screen of your digital devices suppress the production of melatonin, a hormone in your brain that helps you fall asleep. That is why you can stay awake all night strolling on social media without batting an eyelid. 

## 4. Maintain Good Feeding Habits

Our bodies can't function well without food. However, what you eat is as important as how and when you eat. Eating heavy meals before bedtime makes it difficult to fall asleep. That's because your body has to work overtime to digest the food. 

Also, late-night meals containing spicy and acidic food can give you heartburn or stomach troubles, disrupting your sleep. Taking too much alcohol and caffeinated beverages doesn't help either. In fact, taking too much liquid at night is not advised as it increases your chances of waking up frequently to use the restroom.

## 5. Practice Mindful Meditation

According to research published in the National Library of Medicine, mindful meditation helps to improve your overall sleep pattern and reduces stress. Sometimes, you can't sleep because you are stressed or overthinking. The troubles that come with adulthood are never-ending. You're either thinking about how to pay your bills, ace a test at school, deliver a report at work or make extra money. 

You will always have a lot to think about, but practising mindfulness helps you disengage from those agitating thoughts that steal your sleep. Take a minute or two away from the hustle and bustle of the day. Sit in a quiet corner of your room, close your eyes, and take a deep breath. 

## 6. Exercise Regularly 

Yes, we know you don't like to hear it, but exercising is an effective way to fix your insomnia permanently. It is a natural therapy that rejuvenates your body, reduces stress, and improves sleep quality. If you exercise regularly for at least six months, chances are that it will reduce your insomnia symptoms significantly. Work out regularly, but don't do it before bedtime as it stimulates your body and releases endorphins that keep you awake. 

## 7. Yoga 

Yoga is another effective way to fix your insomnia permanently. It regulates your breathing, calms your nerves, and relaxes your body. Studies on the effect of yoga show that yoga affects the parasympathetic nerves that control your body's ability to rest and helps you get better sleep. 

Try practising a simple 15 minutes yoga pose before bedtime. You can do an arm stretch, neck roll, corpse pose, back stretch, or shoulder roll. It will loosen your muscles and prepare your body for a good nightâ€™s rest. 

## Conclusively

Sometimes, a lifestyle change is all you need to get your sleep rhythm back on track. Following the simple tips above will help keep your mind and body in sync so you can get that much-needed sleep. You can also try out some safe and effective herbal supplements and teas that could help. If you need more help, you can consult a doctor here for further guidance.
