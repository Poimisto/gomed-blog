Being diagnosed with diabetes is not a death sentence. We know it was not the news you expected when you visited the clinic for your medical checkup. But when your doctor shared the diagnosis, it hit you like a tsunami, and you've been having a hard time wrapping your head around it.

Don't worry. All hope is not lost. You can live a healthy and fulfilled life even with diabetes. Yes, it will come with many lifestyle changes, but it is doable. You can start by acquiring the health devices and supplies you need to keep this disease at bay.

In this article, we will share some essential items you need to manage diabetes. Let's call it your diabetes care kit. It doesn't matter if you've just been diagnosed or are caring for a loved one living with diabetes. This is the trusted guide you need to start on the right foot.

## 5 Essential Items You Need to Manage Diabetes

Now, let's get into the crux of the matter. Here's a list of the essential items you need to manage diabetes effectively.

### 1. Glucose Monitoring Supplies

The first items you need in your diabetes care kit are glucose monitoring supplies. These items help you track and regulate your blood sugar level to know when it is high or low. Whether you are diagnosed with type 1, type 2 or gestational diabetes, you need to check your sugar level regularly. Glucose monitoring supplies include; a glucometer, disposable test strips, lancets, and lancing devices.

* Glucometer: It is also known as a blood sugar monitor or glucose meter. It is a portable electronic device that measures your blood sugar level. You can use a record book or note app to track your glucose readings. However, many glucometers have a memory space that records all your glucose readings. Some even have a voice function and can compute your daily average blood sugar.

* Disposable Test Strips: These test strips work hand-in-hand with the glucometer to measure your blood sugar level. When your blood drops on the test strip, it reacts with the chemical that produces glucose in your blood. With the electric terminals of the test strip, the glucometer can pick up the reaction and display your blood sugar level. Remember, you must only use a test strip once.

* Lancets and Lancing Devices: Lancets or lancing devices are small tubes used to prick your skin and draw a small blood sample to test your blood sugar level.


### 2. Insulin Supply Kit

People living with type 1 diabetes are insulin dependent. That means they need a regular supply of insulin and its accessories to regulate their blood sugar level. They include; insulin pumps, syringes, needles, disposable insulin pens, sharps containers, glucose tablets or gels, glucagon shot kits, and ketone test strips.

* Insulin: Depending on your diagnosis, your doctor may recommend either a rapid-acting, regular, short-acting, intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin. Insulin can be stored in the refrigerator. But you must make sure the cold insulin warms up to room temperature before using it to avoid pain and irritation. An open bottle of insulin should be stored at room temperature. However, we recommend discarding it after a month.

* Syringes and Needles: They are used for injecting insulin into your body. Some insulin syringes come with a magnifying lens which helps you read the dosage. You can use a safety guard to steady the needle when taking insulin shots.

* Disposable or Reusable Insulin Pen: It is a device used to draw and inject insulin doses. Disposable insulin pens have pre-filled cartridges that should be discarded after use, while reusable insulin pens have insertable cartridges that can be replaced.

* Insulin Pump: An insulin pump is a small device connected to a thin tube known as a catheter that automatically delivers insulin into your body. If you use an insulin pump, you will need infusion sets, extra batteries, and reservoirs to hold the insulin.

* Sharps Container: A sharps container is used to dispose of needles and sharp objects safely. You can use it to dispose of used needles, lancets, and insulin pen needles. Do not throw them in the trashcan as it can pose a risk to others. The container should be disposed of safely when it is full.

* Glucose Tablets or Gels: These are fast-acting glucose sources that you can use to quickly raise your blood sugar level in case of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).

* Glucagon Shot Kits: Glucagon is a hormone that helps to raise blood sugar levels in case of severe hypoglycemia. If you or your loved one is using insulin, it is essential to have a glucagon shot kit in your diabetes care kit.

* Ketone test strips: Ketone test strips are used to test for the presence of ketones in the urine, which can be an indicator of high blood sugar levels or uncontrolled diabetes. It is essential to have ketone test strips in your diabetes care kit to monitor your ketone levels.

### 3. Diabetes Food Stash

Your nutrition plays a significant role in managing diabetes. So, you must pay attention to what you eat. To control your blood sugar levels, you must include healthy food options in your diet. Switch from eating processed food to whole plant meals rich in fibre like vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds, wholewheat pasta, and brown rice. They are easy to digest and boost your immune system. Drink water and low-sugar fruit juice regularly to stay hydrated.

Contrary to popular opinion, pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes do not need a completely sugar-free diet. However, we recommend eating healthy meals and snacking on fruits when those preggy cravings sneak up on you. If you are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you need to watch your weight by eating smaller portions and exercising regularly. It will help you control your weight, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.

### 4. Foot Care Supplies

High blood pressure in diabetes affects the blood vessels and nerve sensations, increasing the risk of sustaining injuries. It also slows down the rate at which your wounds heal. The lower limbs are the most affected parts of the body. That is why foot ulcers are common among people living with diabetes.

You must take good care of your feet to prevent that from happening. Get toenail scissors, emery board, nail file, seamless / padded socks, and home slippers. Ensure you inspect your feet daily to identify any bruises, cuts, or blisters early enough. Don't walk around barefooted. Always put on footwear, even at home.

### 5. Dental Care Supplies

Last on our list of essential items you need to manage diabetes are dental care supplies. Remember how diabetes affects the nerves and blood vessels in your foot. That could happen to your teeth. It increases your risk of gum diseases, bruises, and other dental problems.

To avoid this, you must maintain good dental hygiene every day. Buy a toothbrush with soft, rounded bristles that won't hurt your gum. Remember to change your toothbrush every three months. You must not wait till the bristles are old and worn out. We also recommend using fluoride toothpaste, dental floss, and antiseptic mouthwash.

## Conclusion

Finally, remember emergencies can occur at any time. So, donâ€™t forget to stock emergency supplies for such situations. Depending on the severity of your condition, we recommend having a good supply of diabetes pills, insulin and insulin supplies, fast-acting sugar sources like glucose tablets and gel, and extra batteries for your glucometer.
