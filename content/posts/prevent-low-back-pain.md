Mr. Bassey is a highly placed sales executive with a multinational agency. His job description involves closing multi-million-dollar deals while sitting in his air-conditioned office daily from 9 am to 5 pm. He has a secretary at his beck and call and only needs to stand to use the convenience.

Mr. Bassey has a cousin in the village called Uko. Uko is a mason and a hustler by every standard. He works under the sun and rain, lifting heavy buckets of cement, sand and other building materials. Uko works for long hours, hardly ever resting unless he is on the verge of breaking down due to fatigue.

Unknown to either, Mr. Bassey visited his doctor in the best private hospital in town, while Uko visited the general practitioner in the government hospital on the same day. They both have the same chief complaint, low back pain.

Let's consider this. Mr. Bassey leads a sedentary life, while Uko is always stressed. So, why should two men with different lifestyles develop the same health challenge?

Here's another thing. Mr. Bassey and Uko noticed their back ache a month ago but never took it seriously. They kept managing it until Mr. Bassey could barely sit up at work, and Uko could no longer bend to lift a bucket. This may be the same with you. You treat bone and joint-related ailments as less severe than malaria or gastroenteritis when in reality, these ailments can reduce your life span to a much greater extent than many other illnesses.

## Causes of Low Back Pain

There are several causes of low back pain, such as herniated disk, facet joint damage, compression Fracture, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, etc., but all these would mean nothing to you. So, let's focus on daily habits predisposing you to this salient ailment.

It is also important to note that, for some persons, lower back pain could be hereditary, as recent studies have shown that there is indeed a relationship between lower back pain and genetics. Have you noticed a trend in your family? The pain may have begun with your grandad, and now your dad or brother suffers from it too. Then, you might be at risk of developing low back pain. Do not fret. It just means you will have to be more deliberate about avoiding it.

Here are daily habits that can lead to low back pain.

**1. Sleeping on a Saggy Mattress**

This is very common. Do you enjoy sleeping on mattresses that sink when you lie on them? You may find them comfy, but they increase pressure on your spine, eventually leading to back aches.

**2. Wearing High Heels**

Ah! Our slay queens have left the group chat. We know you love wearing heels because they make you look elegant. However, when you wear heels repetitively, your spine and hips could lose their alignment, resulting in low back pain. As much as we don't want you to lose your sense of style, you can slay with moderation.

**3. Sitting in One Position for Too Long**

Do you like sitting in a spot for long hours? Before you say "No," remember how you sit behind your desk at work for six hours from Monday to Friday. You hardly get up to take a break because your secretary is on standby, ready to run all your errands. You are not helping your back! All you home buddies and couch potatoes are not exempted. You lie on the couch doing Netflix and chill all day while your back pays the heavy price. 

**4. Smoking**

You probably know smoking causes lung and throat cancer, but we bet you don't realise it reduces calcium absorption in your body. Inevitably, calcium reduction inhibits new bone growth. That's not all. The nicotine in cigars also dries up your spinal discs by restricting the blood that flows to that region. These dry discs crack and injure easily. Don't you think that's a high price to pay for a few minutes of pleasure?

**5. Lifting Heavy Weights**

It's no secret that gyming has become a fashionable trend. Of course, exercising is good for your body, and building your biceps and triceps is okay, but only carry what you can. Don't try to impress anyone by lifting more dumbbells than you can comfortably bear. It can bend your spine and cause back aches. Lifting weights in the wrong posture can also cause an injury to your back.

**6. Poor Sleep Routine**

Regardless of the nature of your job, always find time to rest. Your body needs adequate sleep. When you don’t get enough sleep, you don’t give room for your back muscles to recover from your daily activities. Studies have also shown that lying on your belly strains your back muscles. It increases your risk of developing low back aches.

**7. Stressing the Back Muscles**

The natural order of things is for muscles to contract and then relax. Hence, if you stress your back muscles constantly without giving them time to relax, you will develop low back pain in the long run. 

Now, let's move to the crux of the matter. How can you avoid low back pain?
 
## How to Prevent Low  Back Pain

Here are seven ways you can prevent low back pain. 

**1. Engage in muscle strengthening and stretching exercises.**

Get a trained gym instructor to guide you on such exercise activities. If you can't afford a gym membership, watch workout videos on YouTube. At home, you can do simple exercises like walking, jogging, skipping, climbing the stairs, etc.

**2. Learn how to maintain the correct posture.**

Sit up straight. Stand upright. Don't slouch while standing or slump over your desk while sitting. It prevents undue stress on your back muscles, thus preventing low back pain.

**3. Avoid heavy lifting unless you apply proper posture.**

Bend your knees and keep your back straight while lifting weights. It transfers some of the pressure from your back to your legs. Instead of carrying large backpacks with books or laptops daily, consider using a handbag to avoid backache. Alternatively, you can keep these items in a designated storage space at work to avoid carrying them every day. 

**4. Eating healthy.**

Healthy meals give your muscles and ligaments adequate nutrition to prevent inflammation. It helps in the repair of worn-out tissues. Increase your calcium and vitamin D intake by taking milk and other dairy products, green vegetables, fatty fish, egg yolks, and vitamin supplements. GoMed offers a range of health supplements that can improve your bone, muscles, and joints. As you eat, practice portion control, so you don't become overweight.  
  
**5. Invest in good furniture.**

Buy a good chair and work table if you work remotely or your job involves sitting for long hours. Buy a good mattress, and invest in your health. The cost of living with low back pain is far more than buying these furniture pieces.

Also, set your furniture right. The best chairs are the ones with straight backs and low back support. Your system should be positioned at arm's length, and the top of your monitor or laptop should be two to three inches above your eye level. Note that a monitor is usually better for office use than a laptop. While using a laptop, you bend your head, creating pressure on the vertebrae.

**6. Learn to wear the right shoes.**

Avoid sky-high heels. One-inch heels are preferable, but if you have to wear higher heels, carry along flats that you can change into once you feel uncomfortable. We recommend wearing flats more often to help your back, calves, and ankles.

**7. Maintain good posture.**

Make a conscious effort to maintain good posture while sitting, standing, and even sleeping. You can sleep on your side and fold your knees towards your chest. Or lie on your back and place a pillow under your knees or lower back. When you sit in a position for too long and feel cramps in your legs, get up and move around. Perform  simple stretches that would improve blood circulation around your back.
