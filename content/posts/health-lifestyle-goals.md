Most people believe they are healthy because they don't feel feverish or have headaches. We bet you think that too. As long as you don't have symptoms of malaria and have not been admitted to the hospital for a long while, then you're healthy, right?

How wrong could you be!

Healthy living means being in a state of balance, both physically and mentally. So, you see! To be considered healthy, your physical and mental components must function properly. Unfortunately, in this part of the world, most people pay attention to their physical health while ignoring their mental well-being. This year, we must debunk that mindset.

Now, the big question is, what does healthy living entail?

How can you maintain a healthy lifestyle this year?

Don't worry; we got you! We know you want to get it right. That's why we've curated a list of healthy lifestyle goals you should practise this year. It's not an extensive list, but it's a good place to start. 

For better understanding and clarity, we will discuss these goals under three categories.

## Mental/Emotional Goals

This year, we are taking our mental health seriously and shielding it from all forms of toxicity. We are scrapping out everything that stressed us mentally, kept us up at night, made us lose our self-esteem, and developed unhealthy complexes last year. In place of all that negative energy, we will add the following to our daily life.

### Getting Enough Sleep and Rest

"You snooze, you lose!" 

We sure heard a lot of this “motivational speech” last year. However, this year, we're letting it go. 

"Why?" you ask. 

So, here's the thing. If you think carefully, you realise that the statement invalidates the importance of adequate rest and sleep to your mind and body by implying that any minute break can make you lose everything.  

We know you want to make a lot of money this year. However, as you work hard, you must also find time to rest. Body no be firewood o! Even machines need breaks, and so does your body. It's okay to take a break when you're exhausted.

Adequate sleep reboots your body and makes it better equipped to function each day. Studies have shown that failing to get at least 8 hours of sleep each night can take a huge toll on your health. Also, mental fatigue can impede your cognitive abilities and coordination, which you need to achieve your career and business goals.  

### Starting Each Day With a Renewed Mind

After a good night’s rest, don't just wake up and delve into the business of the day. There are certain things that help to set the right mood for each day. For religious people, it could be prayers or a few minutes of meditation. For others, it could be exercise, yoga practice, or listening to inspiring words of affirmation. Before you head out the door, take a few minutes to prepare your mind for the day's affairs. 
 
### Identifying and Cutting-off Toxicities

Indulging in certain practices and associating with some people can be detrimental to your mental health. It builds up negative energy in your system that could eventually result in a mental breakdown. The side effects include depression, anxiety, irritability, and suicidal thoughts. Whatever you do this year, guard your space. Be wary of the content you feed your eyes on social media. Don't accommodate toxic friendships and relationships. Don't listen to words and comments that can hurt you, even if it's a joke. Your mind is fragile and should be shielded from anything and anyone that can damage it.


## Nutritional Goals
The food you eat is vital to your health. "You are what you eat" is as true as it sounds. However, healthy eating is easier said than done. How often have you resolved to stop drinking soda, only to take a bottle at your friend's birthday party? You said you would stop eating junk food last year. How long did that last? 

If you want to eat healthily this year, you must be disciplined and intentional. Here are a few nutritional goals you can imbibe. 

### Drink Water Regularly

Water is life. It is the key element for most of your body processes. That is why we recommend drinking at least eight glasses of water daily to ensure optimum body metabolism. Swap sugary, caffeinated, and alcoholic drinks with water. You may not see its value now, but it will save you from health complications like kidney stones, kidney failure, hypertension, diabetes, and even obesity.

### Eat Breakfast and Avoid Late-Night Meals

In a world where everyone is always on the move, skipping breakfast and eating late at night has become a common routine. Unless you're fasting, refrain from skipping meals. You may say, "Is it not just breakfast?" However, you should know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It pumps you up with the energy you need to work. It also boosts your immune system and concentration. Most importantly, eating breakfast keeps peptic ulcer away. 

As you make a mental note to start eating breakfast, stay away from late-night meals. Eating late at night makes you susceptible to unnecessary weight gain because your body processes food less at night. Yes, that may be why you've put on a lot of weight lately. It also causes acid reflux which can lead to abdominal pain and insomnia.
 
### Balanced Diets
As you create your meal plan for the year, ensure to include all six classes of food. In case you've forgotten, let's refresh your memory. The six main classes of food are carbohydrates, protein, fats/oil, vitamins, minerals, and water. You should know the foods that fall into each category. Did you notice that water is in a class of its own? More reasons you should drink water regularly.  


## Physical Fitness Goals

When was the last time you exercised? Contrary to what you may think, exercising is not just for people looking to shed weight. Regardless of your age and size, exercise is good for your physical well-being. It strengthens your bones and muscles, boosts energy, improves brain and heart function, and promotes sound sleep. Exercising also prevents diseases like stroke, hypertension, diabetes, low back pain, arthritis, and even dementia. 

Start exercising today. You can start with something as simple as jogging early in the morning or taking a stroll in the evening. Then, you can take it a notch higher by registering in a gym and doing cardio exercises. If you can't afford a gym membership, you can watch workout videos on YouTube and practice in the comfort of your home. 


## Conclusion

Practising healthy lifestyle goals may seem like a herculean task, but it becomes easier as you go. With the right mindset and discipline, you can achieve it. You can start by taking baby steps today. Looking back 12 months from now, you'd be amazed at the significant improvement in your health.
