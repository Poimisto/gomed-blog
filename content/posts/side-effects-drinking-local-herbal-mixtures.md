"Come and buy your Agbo Jedi-Jedi, Agbo-Iba, and Oroki. E dey cure typhoid, malaria, pile, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and all dem yama yama diseases." 

We bet you've heard this famous line from an agbo seller marketing his wares in the motor park or local market. These herbalists are tenacious in their trade. They swear by the efficacy of their herbal mixture and share compelling testimonials that leave you in awe of its wonders. 

However, we can't help but wonder, "How can one drug be so effective in treating multiple unrelated diseases?" 

That's the first red flag that should make you weary of drinking such concoctions. Don't roll your eyes at us o. We know you like buying local herbal mixtures because they are cheap, easily accessible, and presumed to be effective. However, research has shown that they are also harmful to your health. 

So, before you run off to buy another herbal mixture, ask yourself, "Is it safe?"

Many people tend to blur the lines between local and orthodox medicine. They assume both can be used interchangeably because they seemingly serve the same purpose. Before we delve into the crux of the matter, let's shed some light on this to clear your misconceptions.

## Differences Between Herbal Mixtures and Pharmaceutical Drugs

Local herbal mixtures are obtained from plants and plant extracts. Just like pharmaceutical drugs, they are primarily produced for medicinal purposes. 

Do you know that some pharmaceutical drugs were initially gotten from plant sources, but are now made synthetically? 

Yes! Research by the United States Department of Agriculture shows that 40% of prescription and over-the-counter drugs are derived from plants. Some common examples are aspirin, quinine, and cough syrup.

We know what you're itching to ask. If both local herbal mixtures and pharmaceutical drugs are made from plants, why do we kick against the former?

So, here's the thing. While herbal and pharmaceutical drugs may seem like two peas in a pod, there are significant differences. 

First, unlike pharmaceutical drugs with clearly defined ingredients and dosages, herbal mixtures are made from unknown plant sources. Some don't even have labels. We know they are made from plants, but we don't know which plants were used and the exact proportion of the mixture. 

Many people assume that herbal mixtures are safe because they are natural. However, their usage is unregulated as they have not been scientifically tested for efficacy, dosage, and toxicity. We hope you know that while plants have nutritional and medicinal values, some of their components can be poisonous too. Orthodox medicine uses only the active and essential ingredients of plants, whereas agbo sellers use the whole plant without proper testing and processing to eliminate the toxic components. 

Moreover, pharmaceutical drugs are prescribed by trained and professional medical practitioners after proper testing and diagnosis. In contrast, agbo sellers base their crafts on blind techniques. No lab test, no vitals, no dosage. Just blind diagnosis and hasty prescriptions. 


## Side-Effects of Drinking Local Herbal Mixtures 

Now, let's enlighten you on the various side effects of drinking local herbal mixtures, so you will be more cautious of the things you ingest into your body.

The side effects of drinking local herbal mixtures include:

**1. Damage to Your Liver**

As we said earlier, herbal mixtures are made from unknown plant sources. Some contain toxic substances that can damage your liver. They have been proven to cause liver failure, inflammation, and hepatitis. In severe cases, you may need a liver transplant, and it could even lead to death. So before you ask them to mix agbo for you, consider the risk you're exposing yourself to.

**2. Kidney Failure**

Your kidney is another sensitive organ that can be damaged by excessive consumption of local herbal mixtures. Herbal mixtures contain certain toxic ingredients that disrupt your body's mineral balance. Your kidneys are responsible for flushing out these toxins. When you put your kidneys under such pressure repeatedly, it weakens them over time. The resultant effects are kidney failure and kidney stones.

**3. Risk of Overdose**

Remember, local herbal mixtures do not have prescriptions or specific dosages. You cannot categorically tell how much quality would be enough "to do the work". It's all guesswork. This puts you at risk of an overdose, and you know what happens when you take drugs in excess quantity.

**4. Allergic Reactions**

Do you know there are some drugs you shouldn't take because you may be allergic to them? 

Similar to food allergies, you can also have a drug allergy. For example, some people experience abdominal pain and diarrhoea when they take drugs coated with gel capsules like Antimalarial Drugs. That's because they are allergic to the gelatin content of the capsule.  

At least pharmaceutical drugs come with labels that warn you of these adverse reactions. Whereas, with local herbal mixtures, it's a dangerous gamble. You donâ€™t know the content of the mixture and how it interacts with your body. So, you can't tell if the rashes and bumps on your skin were triggered by the herbal medicines you've been drinking lately. 

Other allergic reactions include; nausea, vomiting, itching, wheezing, swelling, dizziness, fatigue, dry mouth, difficulty breathing, and tachycardia. These allergies can degenerate into severe conditions like asthma, ulcer, seizures, etc.

**5. Congenital Malformation**

Have you seen babies or children with abnormalities like poorly developed organs or physical deformities?

Studies show that most of these malformations result from herbal mixtures consumed by their mothers during pregnancy. 

If you are a pregnant woman reading this, please avoid local herbal mixtures. Your mum or aunty in the village may have said it would make your baby strong and healthy. We know they mean well, but unless they are licensed medical professionals, you should not take such advice from them. 

As an expectant mother, you should only take drugs prescribed by your doctor during and even after pregnancy. That local herbal concoction can harm the young foetus in your womb. Better safe than sorry. 

## Conclusion 

You must be cautious of what you eat and drink, drugs included. To be safe, only take medications prescribed by a medical doctor when you're sick. Don't take drugs because of the wonderful testimonies your family members or friends may have shared. Remember, we all have different body compositions and tolerance thresholds. So, what works for them might not work for you. 

Also, stop using your financial status as an excuse for patronising unregulated herbal medicines. We know the economy is hard, but it's better to pay the price now than spend more later to treat complications arising from such substandard products. Trust us, the money you will spend buying that prescription drug is nothing compared to the cost of getting a kidney or liver transplant. It could even cost you your dear life! Choose wisely and stay safe!
